# React_VR_With_WebVR_Polyfill

This is a hello world project from the React-VR which includes the webVr Polyfill package to enable the "View in VR Mode" in any devices.

To give an idea on this:
A WebVR project runs only in selective devices and browsers. But thanks to WebVR-Polyfill package, the VR mode from the WebVR can be showed in any devices and any browser.

I simply copied the changes made from the repo: https://github.com/magnus-bergman/reactvr-with-webvr-polyfill the changes made in the file: vr/index.js

The above repo for some reason isn't showing the React-VR project in VR-Mode.

But I have tested it from my iPhone6s Google chrome browser, it works well in the Google Cardboard.
